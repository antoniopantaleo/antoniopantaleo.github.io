  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead"> I am back, after a few days of vacationing with family. Weather was awesome, the beach was full of nasty jelly-fish, yuk! All-in-all, life has been good. I hope life has been as good for all of you. </p> <p class="lead"> My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals. </p>'

      content: "Cold calling can be a great way to generate quality leads. You get to speak to the gatekeepers and stakeholders, and you get a great insight into their requirements and influences. But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, it’s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression."
