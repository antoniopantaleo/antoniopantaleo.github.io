Oh, hey. Glad to see you there!

My name is Antonio, an engineer located in Turin, Italy, who likes calling himself a *techurious* (nope, that's not a strange kind of two-headed dinosaur. It's the union of the words *tech* and *curious*).

Since I was a kid, I loved using computers. I was lucky to have some of them in my parents' house. I remember when I used PowerPoint to make quiz-like games whose final result was up to the user decisions (the *user* was always me; sad story).

I grow up with more and more interest in that thing called `code`. I studied for it and made it part of my life. I love making iOS apps, solve problems, creates projects with fancy names and logos and make scripts that can make my life easier (they call them Life-Hacks no?).

Currently I work as an iOS Engineer in [Iriscube Reply](https://www.reply.com/iriscube-reply/en/), where we make apps... don't move... for banks! Yeah banks! Where money comes from! I love my job and I like to put some little sparkles of nerdy things on it.
